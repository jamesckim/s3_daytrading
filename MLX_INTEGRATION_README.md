## üîß Installation

```bash
# Install MLX (requires Apple Silicon)
pip install mlx

# Verify installation
python -c "import mlx; print('MLX installed successfully')"
```

## üö¶ Quick Start

### 1. Convert Existing Model

```python
from pytorch_to_mlx_converter import convert_model

# Convert your trained PyTorch model
mlx_path, config = convert_model("checkpoints/best_model.pth", "mlx_models")
```

### 2. Run Inference with MLX

```python
from mlx_production_inference import MLXProductionInference

# Initialize MLX inference
inference = MLXProductionInference("mlx_models/best_model/model.npz")

# Process single symbol
signal = inference.process_symbol("AAPL", aapl_data)

# Process batch (much faster!)
signals = inference.process_batch(["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"], data_dict)
```

### 3. Use Hybrid System

```python
from hybrid_inference_system import HybridInferenceSystem, InferenceConfig

# Configure hybrid system
config = InferenceConfig(
    use_mlx=True,
    mlx_threshold=5,  # Use MLX for 5+ symbols
    fallback_to_pytorch=True
)

# Process with automatic framework selection
system = HybridInferenceSystem(config)
signals = system.process_symbols(symbols, data)
```

### 4. Real-Time Market Scanning

```python
from mlx_realtime_scanner import MLXRealtimeScanner, ScanCriteria

# Setup scanner
scanner = MLXRealtimeScanner(symbols=sp500_symbols)

# Define criteria
criteria = ScanCriteria(
    rsi_oversold=30,
    rsi_overbought=70,
    volume_spike_threshold=2.0
)

# Scan market
opportunities = scanner.scan_market_sync(criteria)
```

- [ ] Feature store
- [ ] Vectorized backtesting
- [ ] Full production rollout

## üéØ Key Benefits

### 1. **Speed**
- Process 100 symbols in the time PyTorch processes 30
- React to market changes 3x faster
- Enable real-time scanning of entire market

### 2. **Memory Efficiency**
- Run on MacBook Air instead of expensive servers
- Process S&P 500 in <1GB RAM
- Enable complex multi-model ensembles

### 3. **Scalability**
- Scan 3000+ stocks vs current 34
- Run multiple timeframe models simultaneously
- Process entire option chain in real-time

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing

### Run Performance Demo
```bash
python mlx_migration_demo.py
```

This will:
- Benchmark MLX vs PyTorch
- Test batch processing at scale
- Demonstrate market scanning
- Generate migration report

### Run Individual Tests
```bash
# Test MLX inference
python test_mlx_performance.py

# Test vectorized indicators
python mlx_vectorized_indicators.py

# Test real-time scanner
python mlx_realtime_scanner.py
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

The hybrid system automatically tracks performance:

```python
# Get performance summary
summary = system.get_performance_summary()
print(f"MLX used: {summary['mlx_percentage']:.1f}% of the time")
print(f"Average speedup: {summary['mlx_speedup']:.1f}x")
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Apple Silicon Required**: MLX only works on M1/M2/M3 Macs
2. **Gradual Migration**: Use hybrid system for safe transition
3. **Keep PyTorch**: Continue using PyTorch for training
4. **Monitor Accuracy**: Always validate MLX predictions

## üîç Troubleshooting

### MLX Import Error
```bash
# Ensure you're on Apple Silicon
python -c "import platform; print(platform.processor())"
# Should show 'arm'
```

### Memory Issues
```python
# Use batch processing for large datasets
# Process in chunks of 100-500 symbols
for chunk in chunks(symbols, 100):
    results = scanner.process_batch(chunk, data)
```

### Performance Not Improving
```python
# Ensure you're using batch operations
# Bad: process symbols one by one
# Good: process all symbols at once
signals = inference.process_batch(all_symbols, all_data)
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Convert inference for current 34 symbols
2. **Measure Impact**: Track 3x speedup in production
3. **Scale Up**: Gradually add more symbols
4. **Go Big**: Implement market-wide scanning
