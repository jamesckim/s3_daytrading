   - Sector-specific adjustments
   - Volatility-based position sizing

3. **Risk Management**
   - Tighter stop losses for volatile stocks
   - Position size limits based on liquidity

## Conclusion

The S3 strategy shows promise but requires significant filtering and optimization when applied to high-volume stocks. The strategy works best with:
- Large-cap, liquid stocks
- Moderate volatility environments
- Stocks with consistent trading patterns

The current parameter set is too aggressive for highly volatile small-cap stocks, leading to significant losses. A more selective approach focusing on quality stocks with proven track records would likely yield better results.
